    <h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
    <img src="" alt="Image of me">
    <p>I was born in San Diego CA. I moved to Seattle when I was two and live there until I was thirteen. After that I moved to Vancouver B.C. and have lived here since. As a kid I was very active and played a lot of sports which is still a big part of my lifestyle today. These days to stay active I workout, play sports, or take my dog out on hikes. I've tried many different career paths and I don't think any of them has kept me as engaged as coding has. And with that being said, I hope you enjoy the rest of this website I have coded!</p>
